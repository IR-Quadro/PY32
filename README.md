# PY32F002Axx Microcontroller Repository

This repository provides a collection of low-level, register-based programming examples for the **PY32F002Axx** series microcontrollers from Puya Semiconductor. These examples demonstrate core functionality using pure C code, without relying on HAL libraries or code generators like CubeMX. The focus is on educational purposes, enabling direct hardware interaction for embedded systems development.

The PY32F002Axx is a high-performance, 32-bit ARM¬Æ Cortex¬Æ-M0+ based MCU designed for cost-sensitive applications requiring low power and wide voltage operation. It supports up to 48 MHz operation, integrated Flash and SRAM, and a rich set of peripherals for general-purpose embedded tasks.
