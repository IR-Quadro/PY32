## üî® General Build & Flash Instructions

###  Building and Flashing from Keil ¬µVision

1. **Open the project file** (`.uvprojx`) in **Keil ¬µVision 5**.  
2. Go to **Project ‚Üí Options for Target‚Ä¶**  
   - Under the **Linker** tab, enable **"Use Memory Layout from Target Dialog"** to ensure the memory configuration matches the **PY32F002Axx** series.  
3. **Build the project** (press **F7** or go to **Project ‚Üí Build Target**).  
4. **Flash the MCU**:  
   - Connect your **SWD debugger** (e.g., ST-Link, J-Link).  
   - Select the correct target device.  
   - Program the generated `.hex` or `.bin` file into Flash memory.  

> üí° **Note:** For CMSIS device headers, include the **Puya-provided pack** (available from [py32.org](https://py32.org)).

##  Converting Keil Output to Binary (.bin) Format

Keil ¬µVision typically produces an `.axf` file (ARM Executable and Linkable Format).  
To generate a raw binary file (`.bin`) suitable for flashing or bootloader use, the **fromelf.exe** tool (included with Keil) can be used to extract the binary image.

### üìÇ Default Location of `fromelf.exe`

| Compiler | Default Path |
|-----------|---------------|
| **ARMClang** (recommended) | `C:\Keil_v5\ARM\ARMCLANG\Bin\fromelf.exe` |
| **ARMCC** (legacy) | `C:\Keil_v5\ARM\ARMCC\bin\fromelf.exe` |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If Keil is installed in a different directory (e.g., `D:\Keil_v5\...`), adjust the path accordingly.

---

### üíª General Command Format

Run the following command in **Command Prompt** (`cmd.exe`) or **PowerShell** from the folder containing your `.axf` file:

```bash
"C:\Keil_v5\ARM\ARMCLANG\Bin\fromelf.exe" --bin <input.axf> --output <output.bin>
```

- <input.axf> ‚Äî Path to your Keil output file (e.g., UART_RX_Interrupt.axf)
- <output.bin> ‚Äî Desired binary file name (e.g., UART_RX_Interrupt.bin)

```bash
"C:\Keil_v5\ARM\ARMCLANG\Bin\fromelf.exe" --bin UART_RX_Interrupt.axf --output UART_RX_Interrupt.bin
```
This command extracts the Flash memory image and produces a compact .bin file.


##  Step-by-Step Tutorial
**1. Build Your Project in Keil ¬µVision**
- Open your .uvprojx project file.
- Build the project (F7 or Project ‚Üí Build Target).
- Find the generated .axf file ‚Äî usually located in the Objects subdirectory:
```bash
C:\YourProject\Objects\UART_RX_Interrupt.axf
```

**2. Open Command Prompt**
- Press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.
- Navigate to the folder containing your .axf file:
```bash
cd C:\YourProject\Objects
```

**3. Run the fromelf Command**
- Execute the conversion command:
```bash
"C:\Keil_v5\ARM\ARMCLANG\Bin\fromelf.exe" --bin UART_RX_Interrupt.axf --output UART_RX_Interrupt.bin
```
- Press Enter to run it.
- A new .bin file will be created in the same directory.

## Programming via UART ISP (puyaisp)

The **puyaisp** tool provides a simple and cost-effective way to flash **PY32F002Axx** (and other **PY32F0xx** series) microcontrollers using the **built-in UART bootloader** over a **USB-to-Serial converter**.  
This method eliminates the need for a dedicated debugger.

**Prerequisites**

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system  
- A **USB-to-Serial converter** (e.g., **CP2102**, **FT232R**) with proper drivers installed  
- Access to **BOOT0 (PB6)** and **nRST (PF2)** pins on your board  
- A **`.bin` file** generated from your Keil project (see the previous section)

**Installation**

1. Open a **Command Prompt** or **Terminal**.  
2. Install the tool and dependencies with:
```bash
   pip install puyaisp pyusb pyserial hid
```

**Hardware Connections**

Connect your USB-to-Serial converter to the PY32F002Axx as shown below (using default USART1 pins ‚Äî alternatives like PA9/PA10 or PA14/PA15 may also be used):

```
USB2SERIAL        PY32F0xx
+--------+      +-----------+
|     RXD| <--- |PA2        |
|     TXD| ---> |PA3        |
|     VDD| ---> |VDD        |
|     GND| ---> |GND        |
+--------+      +-----------+
```
 Power the board via VDD/GND from the converter or an external supply (1.7‚Äì5.5 V).

---
**Entering Bootloader Mode**

To access the factory UART bootloader, choose one of the following methods:

**Method 1 ‚Äì Power-On**

1. Disconnect power from the board.
2. Pull BOOT0 (PB6) high to VDD (or hold the BOOT button if available).
3. Reconnect power.
4. Release BOOT0.

**Method 2 ‚Äì Reset**

1. Keep power connected.
2. Pull BOOT0 high.
3. Briefly pull nRST (PF2) low to GND (or press and release the RESET button while holding BOOT).
4. Release BOOT0.

The MCU should now be in bootloader mode (no user code running).


## Step-by-Step Flashing Tutorial
**1. Prepare the Binary**

Ensure your .bin file is ready (e.g., UART_RX_Interrupt.bin) and note its full path.

**2. Connect Hardware**

Wire the USB-to-Serial converter as described above and plug it into your computer.

**3. Enter Bootloader Mode**

Use one of the methods listed above to activate the bootloader.

**4. Run the Command**

Open a terminal in the directory containing your .bin file and execute:

```bash
puyaisp -f UART_RX_Interrupt.bin
```
This command erases the Flash, writes the binary, and verifies the data.


**Additional Options**

| **Option** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `-u` | Unlock the chip (remove read protection) |
| `-l` | Lock the chip (set read protection) |
| `-e` | Perform chip erase only |
| `-o` | Reset option bytes |
| `-G` | Configure nRST as GPIO |
| `-R` | Configure nRST as RESET (default) |
| `-h` | Show help menu |

---

**Example (Unlock + Erase + Flash)**

```bash
puyaisp -u -e -f UART_RX_Interrupt.bin
```

**Exit Bootloader**

After flashing, reset the MCU (briefly pull nRST low) or power-cycle the board to start running the new firmware.


**Tips**

- **If the tool fails to detect the MCU:**
    - Double-check wiring (TX ‚Üî RX swapped correctly)
    - Verify baud rate (default: 115200)
    - Ensure the MCU entered bootloader mode

- **The tool supports all PY32F0xx devices (including PY32F002Axx)**
